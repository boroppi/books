- Some info on my application:

	HomePage: books.php

	Page to add book: addbook.php // this is accessed from books.php with a button

	Page to Edit books: editbooks.php // this is not accessed via link... because I thought accessing this page should later
	become available via some login information and visible to only admin account. I am guessing we are going to
	implement this next.

	Js scripts are located in scripts folder.
	
	CSS: using bootstraps cdn which require internet connection at least once to load I believe.

- I have chosen OOP approach to handle my database connection because I found that some companies
 are looking for people that has OOP knowledge with PHP and I wanted to improve myself on this subject
and It is kind of simpler to call connect and disconnect method and keep the code maintainable


- I had to research to implement ajax form posting, Encountered many problems some were very little but
was not easy to detect and cost me couple hours to find out what the problem was... the problem was that when 
sending single data for the data part in ajax function It should not include curly braces... 
after finding out that and debugging what I receive on php script via chrome's network tab in dev console
It was easy to figure out the rest of the bugs.
